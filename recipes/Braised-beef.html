    <h1>Braised Beef Recipe</h1>
    <p>
        Braising is a cooking method that involves slowly cooking meat in a covered pot<br>
        with some sort of liquid. In the case of this recipe, chuck roast is braised in a<br>
        mixture of beef broth and red wine. Braising is similar to stewing, but it requires<br>
        less liquid.

    <h2>Nicole's Braised Beef tips and tricks</h2>
    <p>"This is one of the best things I've made in a long time," Nicole says.<br>
        That's high praise! Here are a few beef braising tips and tricks from the expert:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>When it comes to cutting the beef, Nicole says the smaller the better.<br>
            When there's less surface area to brown, it's easier to get the meat evenly seared.</li>
        <li>Nicole likes using a chuck roast for this recipe because it's super moist and tender.<br>
            Plus, it can endure the long cooking time.</li>
        <li>To make it a proper braise, make sure you don't add so much liquid (wine and beef broth)<br> 
            that the meat is submerged. You should still see the tops<br>
            peeking out over the top.
